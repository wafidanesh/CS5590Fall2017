In modern teaching you usually have one way of doing a calculation. This is rigid and boring, and intelligent and creative students rebel against it. Once you allow variations you get all sorts of benefits. Children become more creative. The teacher is encouraging innovation and the children respond. In the Vedic system there are general methods, that always work, for example a method of multiplication that can be applied to any numbers. But the Vedic system has many special methods, when a calculation has some special characteristic that can be used to find the answer more easily. And it's great fun when you spot that method.
